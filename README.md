```

## Setup
1) Put .py file in the same folder as Tekken-7-Player-Displayer.exe
2) Generate player data in-game using that ^ tool. Use the comments listed here in "Tekken Player List.txt" (case insensitive):
    * "No comment" (default)
    * "Connection" (for bad connections), "Desync"
    * "Aight", "Okay", "Good", "Great" for overall set quality (good-only)
    * "No skip", "No re" (rematch), "Lose quit", "Win quit"
    * "Cheat", "Plug"
3) Open and run .py file and see the player/character analyses.
     * You may need to update charprops dict in .py file (line 5) with characters that aren't listed (I add them as I go)
     * "Good%" means how many players with the respective character are listed with any "good" comment, out of the total players with that character.
       * For example, (1/8) Bryan means that only one Bryan player was listed as "good" etc. in their comment

## Notes
* Line 1 in the .txt file is skipped. This is because I don't want to include the default data provided by Tekken-7-Player-Displayer and because I deleted the second line.
* It helps to keep the .txt file in a monospaced font. Adding and removing tabs doesn't affect functionality the way I did it.
* Key comments can be changed easily in the code.
* The Python terminal should be monospaced in order to line up the Good% chart. Maybe you can format it so that this isn't required.
* The comments I left for "Win quit", "No re", and "Lose quit" are a bit inconsistent
* The data I got from the Player Displayer occurred while I was mostly on Heihachi, mostly around Fujin rank, with a wired connection, and I rematched most of the time and played honestly. I play from the Midwest.
