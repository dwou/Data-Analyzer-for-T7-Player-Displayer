# Data-Analyzer-for-T7-Player-Displayer

1) Put .py file in the same folder as Tekken-7-Player-Displayer.exe
2) Generate player data using that ^ tool. Use the comments listed here in "Tekken Player List.txt" (case insensitive):
    * "No comment" (default)
    * "Connection" (for bad connections)
    * "Aight", "Okay", "Good", "Great" for overall set quality
    * "No skip", "No re" (rematch), "Lose quit", "Win quit"
    * "Cheat", "Plug"
    * "Connection", "Desync"
3) Open and run .py file and see player/character analysis.

Note that line 1 in the .txt file is skipped. This is because I don't want to include the default data provided by Tekken-7-Player-Displayer and because I deleted the second line.
